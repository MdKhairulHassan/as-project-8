1. **Innovated Apps Store** is an assignment project developed during my
   training period, created to practice real-world development concepts while
   building a full-featured sample application.

2. The project is not limited to front-end development; I also used core
   **JavaScript** to handle back-end-style logic, data processing, and
   app-related functionalities.

3. The app’s concept is inspired by platforms like the App Store and Google Play
   Store, but with a unique purpose—showcasing a collection of trending and
   popular applications from various well-known companies, not just my own
   created apps. But this website could be use to show a companies all kind of
   created applications.

4. The user interface is built using **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and
   **DaisyUI**, giving the project a clean, responsive, and modern visual
   experience with reusable components.

5. I integrated **Recharts** to generate interactive and dynamic rating charts
   for each application, making the data presentation more meaningful and
   visually engaging.

6. The project is not made for business or commercial use; it is entirely for
   learning, practice, and skill development during my training.

7. Overall, Innovated Apps Store represents a hands-on sample project that
   demonstrates my growing abilities in front-end UI design, logical
   programming, data handling, and building functional, scalable web
   applications suitable for my GitHub portfolio.
